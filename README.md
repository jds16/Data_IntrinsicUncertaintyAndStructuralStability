# Data to reproduce figures from "Assessing the Intrinsic Uncertainty and Structural Stability of Planetary Models: 1) Parameterized Thermal-Tectonic History Models"

The data needed to reproduce a figure can be found in its respective folder.

## Fig2and3
Data for single perturbations and error calculations. The \*REF.out is the unperturbed model. The percentage of the perturbation is listed. For example, \*01perc\* means a perturbation of 1% was applied. The value of beta is given as well. For example, FS15 represents beta=0.15.

## Fig4
The column headers are: beta, initial temperature tested, reactance time, growth (1) or decay (-1)

## Fig5and6
Each file is labeled by the value of Beta tested for the randomized perturbations. Each column of the file represents a different thermal path. The first column is the reference, unperturbed solution. Each row represents a different time step beginning from 0 Myr to 4500 Myr model evolution time with time steps of 1 Myr.

## Fig7and8
This file has the unperturbed thermal evolution in the first column and perturbed evolutions in the remaining columns. Each row is a time step that begins at 0 Myr and ends at 13000 Myr with time steps at intervals of 1 Myr.

## Fig9and10
Data for 1 and 2 mass earth models for models capable of producing present day condtions. For the negative beta cases, the columns are different evolutions, with first being the unperturbed solution. The rows are different timesteps. The water cycling models (WC) have a similar layout.
